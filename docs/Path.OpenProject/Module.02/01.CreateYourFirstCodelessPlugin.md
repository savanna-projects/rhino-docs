**Plugins** are re-usable test actions that be called by the using the literal plugin name and providing the relevant parameters. Plugins are divided into 3 different groups:

1. **Code** - all plugins that are referenced directly or indirectly by Rhino API. These plugins must be written in C# and use certain classes and dependencies.
2. **Plugin** - all codeless plugins that are registered under Rhino API. These plugins must be registered before they can be used. The registration process is similar to dependency installation on any other main language (e.g., pip, maven, nuget, etc.).
3. **External** - Plugins that were written as a microservice and expose a manifest. These plugins can be written in any development language and are referenced under `Manifest.json`.
