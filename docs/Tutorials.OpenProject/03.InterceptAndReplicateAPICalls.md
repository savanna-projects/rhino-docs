Developer tools (or "development tools" or short "DevTools") are programs that allow a developer to create, test and debug software. Current browsers provide integrated developer tools, which allow to inspect a website.  

They let users inspect and debug the page's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allow to inspect the network traffic it causes, make it possible to measure it's performance, and much more.

## Replicate Network Traffic

1. Open `Postman` application. If you do not have it, please make sure you have completed the [Setup Environment](../Tutorials.SetupEnvironment/00.Module.md) Module.
2. Click on `Collections` button under the left actions bar.
3. Click on the `+` sign right next to the `Collections` panel to create a new request.

_**image 1.4 - New Request**_  

1. Select `GET` from the request method list.
2. Type `http://localhost:8085/api/v3/configuration` into `Address` text-box.
3. Click on `Send` button.

At this point a request will be sent and a response will follow shortly after. The response status code is `200` and the response body is `JSON` object with configuration information.
