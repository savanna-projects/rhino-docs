The test will verify that a project by the name `Demo Project` exists and can be retrieved using [Open Project API](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/).  

## Prerequisites

1. A project named `Demo Project` already exists. Follow [Setup Environment](../Tutorials.SetupEnvironment/00.Module.md) if it does not.
2. Change the `driver` value under `Manifest.json` file from `ChromeDriver` to `MockWebDriver`.
3. Change the `driverBinaries` value under `Manifest.json` from `http://selenoid:4444/wd/hub` to `.`

## Test Implementation

> :information_source: **Information**
>  
> The implementation of this test will be done in 2 phases.
>
> 1. Get `Demo Project` id from the projects list.
> 2. Use `Demo Project` id from the projects list to send `GetProjectById` request.  

1. Right click on `TestCases` folder.
2. Select `New File`.  
3. Name your file `Test001GetProjectById.rhino`.
4. Click on `Test001GetProjectById.rhino` file to open it.

1. Type in the following test.

```rhino
[test-id]         TEST-001
[test-scenario]   verify that Demo Project retrieved when sending GetProject API request
[test-categories] API
[test-priority]   1 - critical
[test-severity]   1 - critical
[test-tolerance]  0%

[test-actions]
/**
/** Get the projects list
1. send a get request on {http://openproject/api/v3/projects}
/**
/** Extract the project id from the response and store it into a session parameter named 'project_id'
/** 1. Using JPath to extract the id based on project number.
/** 2. Using \d+ regular expression to take the id number only.
2. register response parameter {project_id} on {$..elements.[?(@.name==='Demo project')].id} filter {\d+}
3. close browser

[test-expected-results]
/**
/** Assert that the first request was successful and the project id was saved.
[1] verify that {status code} equal {200}
[2] verify that {text} on {{$getparam --name:project_id --scope:session}} match {\d+}
```

## Run your Test

Rhino can run the test file directly from `Visual Studio Code`, by executing the invoke command.  

1. Open command palette by pressing `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`P`.
2. Type `Rhino` to find Rhino Commands.
3. Select and run the command `Rhino: Runs the automation test(s) from the currently open document`.
4. A progress indication will show in `Visual Studio Code` status bar.

When test invocation is complete, a report will be opened under a new `Visual Studio Code` tab.

## Breakdown

### Test Metadata

The test metadata holds an important information about your test. There are many metadata fields and it can also use custom fields which are directly derived from your `Application Lifecycle Manager` (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps, Test Rail, XRay, etc.).

| Field           | Meaning                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| test-id         | The unique identifier of the test. Please note the Rhino **will distinct** tests by their ID.                                            |
| test-scenario   | A statement describing the functionality to be tested.                                                                                   |
| test-categories | A comma separated list of categories (also refers as 'Tags' or 'Marks') to which this test belongs to.                                   |
| test-priority   | The level of **business importance** assigned to an item, e.g., defect.                                                                  |
| test-severity   | The degree of **impact** that a defect has on the development or operation of a component or system.                                     |
| test-tolerance  | The % of the test tolerance. A Special attribute to decide, based on configuration if the test will be marked as passed or with warning. |

### Test Actions

The numbers beside each action does not have any affect on the test itself and were designed to increase the test readability and to make it easier to assign expected results for each action based on the action positional location.  

**Actions (Plugins) Call:**  

1. `get request` - sends an HTTP `GET` request to `OpenProject` server on address `http://openproject/api/v3/projects` to get all the available projects.
2. `register response parameter` - gets the project `id` value by using [JPath (JSON Path)](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) on the response body from the previous request.
3. `close browser` - closes the current driver session, without it the driver session will remain available until the next `Rhino API` restart.

### Test Expected Results

The numbers beside each expected result points to the action it asserts based on the action positional number under `[test-actions]` section. It is possible to point multiple assertions to the same action.  

**Actions (Plugins) Call:**

1. `status code` - asserts that the HTTP StatusCode that was returned by the last `GET` request action is `200`.
2. `text` - asserts that the `project_id` parameter value is a number (e.g., match `\d+`).
3. `getparam` - when used within a CLI block (e.g., blocks that starts with `{{$` and ends with `}}`) it will retrieve a parameter by the parameter name and the parameter scope. In our case, the parameter we have saved with the project `id` value. In conjunction with `text` assertion we can evaluate the `project_id` parameter value.
