# Install Docker Compose

Docker Compose relies on Docker Engine for any meaningful work, so make sure you have Docker Engine installed either locally or remote, depending on your setup.  

* On desktop systems like **Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows, Docker Compose is included as part of those desktop installs**.
* On Linux systems, first install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server) for your OS as described on the Get Docker page, then come back here for instructions on installing Compose on Linux systems.
* To run Compose as a non-root user, see [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

## Basic Installation - Linux
On Linux, you can download the Docker Compose binary from the [Compose repository release page on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases). Follow the instructions from the link, which involve running the `curl` command in your terminal to download the binaries. These step-by-step instructions are also included below.  

> :information_source: **Information**
>   
> For `alpine`, the following dependency packages are needed: `py-pip`, `python3-dev`, `libffi-dev`, `openssl-dev`, `gcc`, `libc-dev`, `rust`, `cargo` and `make`.  

1. Run this command to download the current stable release of Docker Compose:  

```bash
$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```  

> :information_source: **Information**
>   
> To install a different version of Compose, substitute 1.29.2 with the version of Compose you want to use.  
> If you have problems installing with curl, see [Alternative Install Options](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#alternative-install-options).  

2. Apply executable permissions to the binary:  

```bash
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```  

> :information_source: **Information**
>   
> If the command `docker-compose` fails after installation, check your path. You can also create a symbolic link to `/usr/bin` or any other directory in your path.  

For example:  
```bash
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
```

1. Optionally, install [command completion](https://docs.docker.com/compose/completion/) for the `bash` and `zsh` shell.
2. Test the installation.  

```bash
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 1110ad01
```
