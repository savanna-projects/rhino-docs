Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:

* A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd.
* APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
* A command line interface (CLI) client docker.  

The CLI uses Docker APIs to control or interact with the Docker daemon through scripting or direct CLI commands. Many other Docker applications use the underlying API and CLI. The daemon creates and manage Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

> For the tutorial sake, Docker hosting was chosen as the hosting method use case. _**This setup is optional**_ and designed for more advanced users. _**You do not have to use Docker**_ in order to run or host Rhino API for use cases that do not requires Docker.
